Project: Needs Assessment for Vulnerable Households in Lebanon
Objective
This project simulates the process of designing and analyzing a needs assessment survey for a non-governmental organization (NGO) operating in Lebanon. The goal is to identify the most pressing needs of vulnerable households (e.g., food security, shelter, healthcare) to inform and guide the NGO's programmatic interventions.
